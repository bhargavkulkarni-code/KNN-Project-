Problem statement – the advertising dataset has information of unnamed, TV, radio, newspaper, sales in this find the dependent and independent variable create labels for dependent variable and write codes for k-neighbors classifier by taking training size is 70% and remaining data for testing and check the accuracy, prepare classification report.



Tools used – pandas, sklearn, k-neighbors classifier, classification report of predicted data.



Outcome – the accuracy of k-neighbors classifier is 80% and precision is 0.900 is highest for 15-20 classification labels. and recall is 0.905 is highest for 10-15 labels classification. And f1 score 0.844 is highest is for 10-15 labels classification.
